Fundamentals of sdlc
--------------------
What are the different stages in the lifecycle of a software development?
requirements gathering,
analysis- nfrs Non functionctional requirements, fr functional requirements identify entities, sequence, flow
design- start design the required architecture, build the code , develop it, testing 
deploy- deploying the project and checking whether it works if not sent again to testing.
maintenance- doing management, monitoring upto its valid time

what would happen in each stage (4-5 points)

What are different methodologies followed in the sdlc

Waterfall-step by step process, going to next step after the 1st step completes totally
Spiral-release projects in versions,
Agile - same as spiral but faster than it (current trend) -continuous improvement
 scrum-complete application is divided into days called sprint, update stories called as product backlog -product manager
sprint - fixed set of tasks
 kanban- no fixed set of tasks- options keep changing
burn chart- graph show what we do and not done

- a reusable code is called as component
---Extension of class libraries is called services.
------Microservices can do only service at a time.It contains one method at a time.

SRS-software requirement specification4
problem statement

 Cost of defect repair, cost of inadequate testing
