*Different phases in testing life cycle
	Requirements analysis- questionnare
	Test planning- 
	Test case design
	Test environment setup
	Test execution
	Test cycle closure
*what is done in each phase
*what are test cases and why-input,process,output 
both manual and automation testing
to check every condition
	The test case is defined as a group of conditions under which a tester determines whether a software application is working as per the customer's 	requirements or not. Test case designing includes preconditions, case name, input conditions, and expected result. A test case is a first level 	action and derived from test scenarios.
*list the difference between manual testing and automation testing
manual-small,step-by-step,time taking,
automation-large coding,can't be done without proper framework,automatically,less time consuming
*list some tools used for testing
selenium
jira
apache jb
protractor
cucumber

*difference between developmnet  environment testing environmnet production environment
dev test-for designing code
envi test-for testing
prod test-for executing//the project to go live // servers
